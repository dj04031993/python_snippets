FICO Tree Testing Process Overview
Presented by: [Your Name], Senior Test Engineer

The validation of FICO decision trees is conducted in three key stages:

EDI → PCF → CSL

As part of the PCF testing strategy, once we receive the business requirement for a specific client implementation, we follow a structured and detailed testing workflow to ensure logic accuracy, data integrity, and alignment with business goals.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the PCF testing process:

Mock Data Creation
We begin by crafting mock data for all input fields used in the given strategy. This ensures controlled and predictable test outcomes.

Branch Coverage
The mock data is designed to cover all branches within the decision tree. This helps validate complete logic flow, including edge paths.

Eligibility Node Validation
We validate the Eligibility node by executing both positive and negative paths. This ensures accounts are assessed correctly based on defined logic.

Treatment Logic Check
We verify the Treatment node ID and confirm the expected treatment value is applied, as per the strategy design.

Table Validation
We check that both Eligible and Ineligible accounts are inserted into the appropriate database tables, maintaining data integrity and traceability.

NFR Verification
We validate all Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs), such as performance, stability, and error handling, under expected load.

Note: Data pull from EDL and updates to downstream systems like Fiserv are out of scope for PCF testing.
